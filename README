  EventSource polyfill for browsers, that doesn't implement native EventSource
  
  Uses XMLHttpRequest:
  "server push" (XMLHTTPRequest Interactive state) logic for Firefox, XDomainRequest for IE8+
  "long polling" or "polling" logic for other browsers

  Browser Support:
  IE7+, others

  Advantages:
  * Based on last specification of EventSource.
  * "server push" for Firefox
  * "server push" for IE 8+ with XDomainRequest
  * Polyfill is independent form document methods (addEventListener), so you
  * can use it in a Web Worker's scope.
  
  
  Server-side requirements:
  When "server push" not supported, "Polling" HTTP Header is sended on each request
  to tell your server side script to close connection after 
  sending a data.
  XDomainRequest sends "Last-Event-ID" with POST body (XDomainRequest object does not have a setRequestHeader method)
  Also XDomainRequest requires send two kilobyte “prelude” at the top of the response stream.
