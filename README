  EventSource polyfill for browsers, that doesn't implement native EventSource
  
  
  Uses XMLHttpRequest:
  "server push" (XMLHTTPRequest Interactive state) logic for Firefox
  "long polling" or "polling" logic for other browsers

  
  Browser Support:
  IE7+, others

  
  Advantages:
  Based on last specification of EventSource.
  "server push" for Firefox
  Polyfill is independent form document methods (addEventListener), so you
  can use it in a Web Worker's scope.
  
  
  Server-side requirements:
  When "server push" not supported, "Polling" HTTP Header is sended on each request
  to tell your server side script to close connection after 
  sending a data.
